PiOS
====

BareBones OS for the Raspberry Pi.

This is intended as a one-stop-shop for handy reusable code for people to build their own OS's for the Raspberry Pi.
It is to provide routines for accessing peripherals such as USB, SPI and so on as well as device drivers
for external hardware connected via USB or the GPIO pins....and if possible the DSI port.
